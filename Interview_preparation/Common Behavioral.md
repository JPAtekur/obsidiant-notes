### 1. Tell me about yourself
My name is Md Atekur Rahman, and I'm currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at BJIT Ltd. I have over 7 years of experience in software development, with a strong focus on Core Java, J2EE, Spring Framework, Hibernate, Spring Boot, Microservices, and Spring Cloud. I’ve also worked extensively with databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL, and I’m well-versed in tools and technologies such as JUnit, Maven, and JIRA.

Throughout my career, I’ve worked across diverse domains including e-commerce and the garments industry, which has helped me understand different business processes and develop domain-driven, scalable solutions. I enjoy writing clean, easy-to-maintain code and using design patterns to build reliable, reusable features.

I’m passionate about solving complex problems and delivering high-quality software that adds real value to the end users. I enjoy mentoring junior developers and contributing to team discussions around architecture and design.

Currently, I’m seeking a senior-level role where I can continue to be hands-on with development while also stepping more into leadership responsibilities — driving technical decisions, improving team productivity, and helping deliver impactful solutions.

### 2. What’s your greatest strength?
One of my greatest strengths is problem-solving. I enjoy breaking down complex technical challenges and finding efficient, practical solutions.

### 3. What's your greatest weakness?
One weakness I’ve been working on is delegation. Sometimes, I take on more work than needed because I want to make sure everything is done properly. But I’ve realised that trusting the team and sharing responsibilities leads to better results. Nowadays, I try to guide and support my teammates more, so they can take ownership and grow — and I can focus on the bigger picture.
